# Uses of Unsupervised Learning

<ul>
<li> Density Estimation 
<li> Finding Latent Variables
<li> Dimensionality Reduction
</ul>

# K Means Clustering

### Algorithm

<b> Initialize: </b><i> Pick K Random Points to be the Cluster Centers. </i> <br>
<i> While not converged: <br>
Assign each points to the nearest cluster center. <br>
Recalculate each cluster center from points that belong to it. </i> <br>
